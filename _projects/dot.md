As a hobby project, I'm building a ~2kg, 3D-printed, servo-driven quadruped from scratch.

For this project, I'm specifically inspired by (and heavily referencing) a combination of [SpotMicro](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [Stanford Pupper](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/pupper). I love the SpotMicro aesthetic, but after printing and playing with a single leg, I found myself speed-limited in the knee by my hobby servos. The Stanford Pupper-style 4-bar knee linkage sidesteps this issue and decreases speed requirements for the knee joint; so I set out to copy that design in an entirely-3D-printed form.

(I'm super impressed by the likes of [MJBots](https://mjbots.com/) and [OpenDog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUbDcUPed50Y_7KmfCXKohA) - but this project is intending to a smaller-scale, both in robot form factor and budget, spec'd for PWM-controlled, feedback-less hobby servos.
