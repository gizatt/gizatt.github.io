# About me

I'm a graduate student with [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) at the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) at MIT CSAIL. I've tackled robotic control, perception, and simulation problems from a variety of angles, and have an eclectic toolbox spanning from bare-metal embedded electronics hacking to mixed-integer formulations of perception and inference problems (with a lot of neat stuff in between).

My research has broadly focused on the *interplay of perception and simulation in robot manipulation*. I've used simulation for many things, like testing Atlas' walking behaviors during the DRC; prototyping perception and control systems for the MIT Hyperloop vehicle before its test flight; or putting robot arm code used by my lab under CI. But simulation can be so much more than that -- in my PhD, I'm wrangling with some fundamental questions about how we can better align simulation to reality in a high-level way -- how we can capture the distribution of real worlds our robots will face, and reproduce that distribution in sim.
