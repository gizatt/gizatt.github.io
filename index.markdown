# About

I'm a graduate student with [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) at the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) at MIT CSAIL. I've tackled robotic control, perception, and simulation problems from a variety of angles, and have an eclectic toolbox spanning from bare-metal embedded electronics hacking to mixed-integer formulations of perception and inference problems (with a lot of neat stuff in between).
