# About me

I am a research engineer at [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com/) working on the [Atlas humanoid robot](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/). I specialize in our high-level motion planning and behavior execution stack, though I consider myself a generalist: I have tackled robotic control, perception, and simulation problems from a variety of angles, and have an eclectic toolbox spanning from bare-metal embedded electronics hacking to mixed-integer formulations of perception and inference problems (with a lot of neat stuff in between).

Here's some cool stuff I've helped make happen!

Formerly, I was a graduate student with [Russ Tedrake](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) at the [Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) at MIT CSAIL, where my research broadly focused on the interplay of perception and simulation in robot manipulation.

In my spare time I work on robots and other engineering projects at home, fiddle with my 3D printer, do some photography ([here's my flickr!](https://flickr.com/people/145719802@N04/)), learn to cook new and exciting things, and play too many video games.
